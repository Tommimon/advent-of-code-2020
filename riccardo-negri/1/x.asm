# MIPS 32bit Program for Day 1 of Advent Of Code 2020 by Riccardo Negri
# Challenge: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1
# Developed using MARS: https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/
# SYSCALL functions available in MARS: https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/Help/SyscallHelp.html
# Part one: find two numbers that add up to 2020 and then multiply them together
# My answer for part one: 988771 (833*1187)
# Part two: find three numbers that add up to 2020 and then multiply them together
# My answer for part two: 171933104 (1237*511*272)
